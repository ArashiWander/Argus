# Autonomous Debugging with Project Argus

## Overview

Project Argus provides comprehensive autonomous debugging capabilities through its AI-powered analytics, anomaly detection, security monitoring, and predictive intelligence systems. This document outlines how to leverage these capabilities for automated issue detection, investigation, and resolution guidance.

## ü§ñ Autonomous Debugging Architecture

Project Argus autonomous debugging works through the integration of multiple intelligent systems:

### Core Components
1. **AI Analytics Engine** - Detects anomalies and generates performance insights
2. **Predictive Analytics** - Forecasts potential issues before they occur
3. **Security Intelligence** - Monitors for threats and suspicious activities
4. **Performance Optimization** - Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. **Alert Correlation** - Connects related events across the system

## üîç Autonomous Detection Capabilities

### 1. Anomaly Detection

The system automatically detects anomalies using multiple statistical algorithms:

#### Available Algorithms
- **Z-Score Analysis**: Detects statistical outliers using standard deviation
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Robust outlier detection for skewed data
- **Moving Average**: Trend-based anomaly detection
- **Seasonal Detection**: Time-pattern-based anomaly identification

#### Automatic Detection Example
```bash
# The system automatically runs anomaly detection every 5 minutes
# Manual trigger example:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/anomalies/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "metric_name": "cpu.usage",
    "service": "web-server",
    "lookback_hours": 24
  }'
```

#### Anomaly Response
```json
{
  "anomalies": [
    {
      "id": "anomaly_xyz123",
      "metric_name": "cpu.usage",
      "service": "web-server",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "expected_value": 45.2,
      "actual_value": 89.7,
      "anomaly_score": 3.2,
      "severity": "high",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Performance Bottleneck Detection

The AI analytics engine automatically identifies performance bottlenecks:

#### Automatic Insights Generation
```bash
# Performance insights are generated automatically
# Manual trigger:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/insights/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Example Performance Insight
```json
{
  "insights": [
    {
      "type": "bottleneck",
      "title": "High CPU utilization detected for api-server",
      "description": "Average CPU usage is 87.3% over the last 24 hours",
      "severity": "warning",
      "affected_services": ["api-server"],
      "recommended_actions": [
        "Consider scaling up CPU resources",
        "Investigate CPU-intensive processes",
        "Implement CPU-based auto-scaling"
      ],
      "confidence_score": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Predictive Issue Detection

The system forecasts potential issues using predictive analytics:

#### Capacity Planning
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/capacity-planning \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "service": "database",
    "resource_type": "memory"
  }'
```

#### Predictive Response
```json
{
  "service": "database",
  "resource_type": "memory",
  "current_utilization": 68.5,
  "capacity_exhaustion_date": "2024-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "recommended_scaling_date": "2024-02-10T00:00:00Z",
  "scaling_recommendations": [
    {
      "action": "Increase memory allocation by 50%",
      "impact": "Prevents capacity exhaustion for 4 weeks",
      "cost_estimate": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Security Threat Detection

Autonomous security monitoring with real-time threat detection:

#### Automatic Threat Evaluation
The system continuously evaluates security events against threat detection rules:

```bash
# Security threats are automatically evaluated
# Manual evaluation:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/security/threats/evaluate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Security Alert Example
```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "rule_name": "Multiple Failed Login Attempts",
      "threat_type": "brute_force_attack",
      "severity": "high",
      "description": "5 failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 in 2 minutes",
      "affected_assets": ["authentication-service"],
      "risk_score": 85,
      "recommended_actions": [
        "Block IP address 192.168.1.100",
        "Enable account lockout after 3 failed attempts",
        "Implement CAPTCHA verification"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

};
```

### Multi-Metric Correlation

Set up correlation analysis:

```typescript
// Correlate multiple metrics for complex analysis
const correlationConfig = {
  primary_metric: "response_time",
  correlation_metrics: ["cpu.usage", "memory.usage", "db.connections"],
  correlation_threshold: 0.7,
  analysis_window: 3600    // 1 hour
};
```

### Intelligent Alert Grouping

  service_grouping: true,
  metric_correlation: true,
  suppression_rules: [
    {
      condition: "maintenance_mode",
      action: "suppress_all"
    }
  ]
};
```
